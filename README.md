# WIP

the search space for this problem is non-trivial. as such we require the use of either:
- a radix tree (trie) with good heuristics to traverse it
- or an ML approach that leverages the seq2seq nature of this problem to produce a soln.

either way, I am still reading literature and trying to construct a MVP in Python as opposed to a direct GUI implementation in JS.

talk soon.
